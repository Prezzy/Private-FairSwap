# Private-FariSwap
Experimental Implementation of Private FairSwap

This directory contains the python programs we implemented as part of our experiments to measure the overhead caused 
by our private FiarSwap. Some of these file are designed to be used with the Pinocchio Compiler for Verifiable Computing. You will need this repository to generate and run arithmetic circuits: https://github.com/corda/msr-vc/tree/master/pinocchio. The Judge.sol file is an Ethereum smart contract that evaluates a Proof of Misbehaviour
